# my_first_blog

This project implements a simple blog application using Flask, a Python web framework.  It leverages several extensions for enhanced functionality and styling:

* **Flask-Bootstrap:** Provides Bootstrap integration for responsive and visually appealing design.
* **Flask-CKEditor:** Integrates CKEditor, a rich text editor, for creating and editing blog posts with formatted content.
* **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** Simplifies database interactions using SQLAlchemy, an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).
* **Flask-WTF:** Facilitates creating and handling web forms, including form validation and CSRF protection.

## Features

* **View Blog Posts:**  Users can view a list of blog posts on the home page, with titles, subtitles, authors, and dates.
* **Read Full Posts:** Clicking on a post title leads to the full post view, displaying the complete content and an image.
* **Create New Posts:**  Authenticated users (implementation not included in this example) can create new blog posts with titles, subtitles, rich text content (using CKEditor), author names, and image URLs.
* **Edit Existing Posts:**  Similar to creating posts, authenticated users can edit existing blog posts.
* **Delete Posts:** Authenticated users can delete blog posts.
* **Contact Form:**  A contact form allows visitors to send messages to the blog owner.  (Email sending functionality needs to be configured â€“ commented out in the example code).
* **About Page:** A simple about page.
